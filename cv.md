### Briefly About Myself:

I started my career and worked as a sales manager for a long time.
From 2013 to 2021, I managed to work in several companies and gain good experience in establishing interaction in various teams.
During my work in various companies, I have achieved high skills of effective interaction both with the company's customers and with the company's employees.
In my career, I have not only been involved in the sale of company products, but also in the management of employees subordinate to me, organize the work of the warehouse and the timeliness of deliveries of goods, organize interaction with carriers for timely and high-quality delivery of goods.
In most companies, I was responsible for the financial component of my work: the timely receipt of payments from customers and payments to suppliers.
All of the above required a high degree of self-organization, as well as the use of effective accounting and control systems, which gave rise to and developed in me an interest in writing computer programs.
At the moment I am taking online Frontend developer courses at the SkillUp school, as well as doing independent study of material on this topic.
